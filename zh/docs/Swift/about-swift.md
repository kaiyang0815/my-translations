# About Swift

Understand the high-level goals of the language.

了解该语言的高级目标。

Swift is a fantastic way to write software for phones, tablets, desktops, servers, or anything else that runs code. It’s a safe and fast programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from a diverse open source community.

Swift 是为手机、平板电脑、台式机、服务器或任何其他运行代码的设备编写软件的绝佳方式。它是一种安全、快速的编程语言，结合了现代语言思维的精华和来自多元化开源社区的智慧。

Swift is friendly to new programmers, without sacrificing the power and flexibility that experienced programmers need. It’s an industrial-quality programming language that’s as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. The compiler is optimized for performance and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either.

Swift 对新程序员很友好，同时又不会牺牲经验丰富的程序员所需的功能和灵活性。它是一种工业品质的编程语言，与脚本语言一样富有表现力且令人愉悦。编译器针 ​​ 对性能进行了优化，语言针对开发进行了优化，两者均不受影响。

Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

Swift 通过采用现代编程模式定义了一大类常见的编程错误：

Variables are always initialized before use.

变量总是在使用前初始化。

Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.

检查数组索引是否存在越界错误。

Integers are checked for overflow.

检查整数是否溢出。

Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.

可选确保显式处理 nil 值。

Memory is managed automatically.

内存是自动管理的。

Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

错误处理允许从意外故障中受控恢复。

Swift code is compiled and optimized to get the most out of modern hardware. The syntax and standard library have been designed based on the guiding principle that the obvious way to write your code should also perform the best. Its combination of safety and speed make Swift an excellent choice for everything from “Hello, world!” to an entire operating system.

Swift 代码经过编译和优化，可以充分利用现代硬件。语法和标准库的设计基于这样的指导原则：编写代码的明显方式也应该表现最好。其安全性和速度的结合使 Swift 成为“Hello, world!”等所有内容的绝佳选择。到整个操作系统。

Swift combines a modern, lightweight syntax that’s familiar for developers coming from other popular languages with powerful features like type inference and pattern matching, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner. As a result, code is easier to read, write, and maintain.

Swift 将来自其他流行语言的开发人员所熟悉的现代轻量级语法与类型推断和模式匹配等强大功能相结合，允许以清晰简洁的方式表达复杂的想法。因此，代码更易于阅读、编写和维护。

Swift continues to evolve with thoughtful new features and powerful capabilities. The goals for Swift are ambitious. We can’t wait to see what you create with it.

Swift 不断发展，带来深思熟虑的新特性和强大的功能。 Swift 的目标是雄心勃勃的。我们迫不及待地想看看您用它创造了什么。
